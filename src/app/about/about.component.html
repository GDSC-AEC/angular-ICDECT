        The objective of 6th International Conference on Data Engineering and
        Communication Technology (ICDECT) 2022 is to present a unique platform for
        advanced and multi-disciplinary research towards design of advanced
        computing, information systems, electronic systems. <br>The theme focuses on
        various innovation paradigms in system knowledge, intelligence and
        sustainability that may be applied to provide realistic solution to
        variegated problems in society, environment and industries. The scope is
        also extended towards deployment of emerging computational and knowledge
        transfer approaches, optimizing solutions in a variety of disciplines of
        Computer Science and Engineering, Electronics and Communication
        Engineering, Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Electronics and
        Instrumentation Engineering. The conference proceedings aim to publish
        real and unpublished work pertaining to the topics mentioned below.<br> The
        main aim of the conference is to offer a real opportunity to bring
        together researchers of different disciplines, to discuss and share new
        issues, to tackle complex problems and to find advanced solutions breeding
        trends in Computer Science, Electronics and Communication Engineering,
        Electrical Engineering. Conference will also provide a platform for
        academicians, research community and industry to share the recent
        developments, and to discuss about the discoveries in computational
        intelligence and informatics.<br> 6th International Conference on Data
        Engineering and Communication Technology (ICDECT-2022) is scheduled to be
        held on August 12th & 13th, 2022 and is organized by Department of CSE,

          Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)</span
        >
        is established with the inception of college in the year 2001. It administers bachelor's programs in Computer Science and Engineering with an intake of 180 students, as well as master's programs in Computer Science and Engineering with intake of 12 students.
We are very proud to say that few students are studying in our dept from various countries like Nepal, Nigeria and from different parts of India. For the better placements we have signed MOUs with various standard assessment organizations like Co Cubes, AMCAT, Elitmus. We have a strong technical team (Technical hub) to train our students in coding practices and problem-solving skills. We are happy to say that our college is having Pearson certified center and we are in associations with many MNC’s like Oracle Academy, CISCO, Infosys Campus Connect, SAP Student Academy Program, Red Hat Academy, Skill Development Center (APSSDC) etc., We are very happy to say that most of our students have been trained and certified in various new technologies and trends which are necessary in the current industries from the first year onwards. We are glad to share this message of our students have been placed in dream companies with packages of more than 10 lakhs. And since last two years averagely placed with package of around 5Lacks.
One of the key factors of our department is our faculty. They are eminent with Industry, teaching and research experiences, committed and sincere about their career. We are very proud to say that our department has 10 PhDs and remaining faculty members are pursuing PhDs in various reputed Universities. The faculty members are actively involved in publishing their research articles in various reputed journals and conferences.
The CSE department has well established and equipped laboratories with high end configuration and computing facilities. The Department has 4 high end servers and 10 laboratories supporting various programming languages, and also facilitates various recent technologies like Datamining tools, ML, IoT etc., The Department also has well equipped PG Lab, Research lab and Computer center with high-speed internet connectivity.The CSE department has many strengths include its high faculty-to-student ratio, state of the art facilities, renowned faculty, strong focus on undergraduate education balanced with leading-edge research, and emphasis on leadership, service, and ethics.
Our faculty members motivate or support the students in getting placed in MNC, to actively participate in various coding competitions like Google Kickstart, TCS Code Vita, Infosys InfyTQ, Virtusa Neural hack etc., to establish start-up's and also encourage more in research articles. The department   also have   ISTE and CSI student chapters organizing various technical events.
